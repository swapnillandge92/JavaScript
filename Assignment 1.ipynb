    "JavaScript is a scripting language that is used to construct online and mobile apps, web servers, games, and more. JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that is used to generate websites and applications. It was created with the intention of being used in a browser. Even today, the server-side version of JavaScript known as Node.js may be used to create online and mobile apps, real-time applications, online streaming applications, and videogames. Javascript frameworks, often known as inbuilt libraries, may be used to construct desktop and mobile programs. Developers may save a lot of time on monotonous programming jobs by using these code libraries, allowing them to focus on the production work of development."

    "Scope in JS determines the accessibility of variables and functions at various parts of one’s code.\n",
    "In general terms, the scope will let us know at a given part of code, what are variables and functions we can or cannot access.\n",
    "There are three types of scopes in JS:\n",
    "1) Global Scope\n",
    "2) Local or Function Scope\n",
    "3) Block Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "    a) Global Scope: Variables or functions declared in the global namespace have global scope, which means all the variables and functions having global scope can be accessed from anywhere inside the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example : \n",
    "    let globalVariable = \"Hello world\";\n",
    "\n",
    "    function sendMessage(){\n",
    "      return globalVariable; // can access globalVariable since it's written in global space\n",

    "    function sendMessage2(){\n",
    "      return sendMessage(); // Can access sendMessage function since it's written in global space\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    sendMessage2();\n",

    "    b) Function Scope: Any variables or functions declared inside a function have local/function scope, which means that all the variables and functions declared inside a function, can be accessed from within the function and not outside of it.\n",

    "    Example:\n",
    "    function awesomeFunction(){\n",

    "      let multiplyBy2 = function(){\n",

    "\n",
    "    multiplyBy2(); // \n",
    "    \n",
    "    C) Block Scope: Block scope is related to the variables declared using let and const. Variables declared with var do not have block scope. Block scope tells us that any variable declared inside a block { }, can be accessed only inside that block and cannot be accessed outside of it.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example :\n",

Because it has a single thread that’s why it can only execute one command at a time and the other commands need to wait for executing before the running command executes. And the term synchronous means one at a time. So after these conversions, we get to know that javascript only executes one command or a single block of code at a time that means it is blocking.\n",
